**Cyro Phoenix**

Build Status

A bot for Pokemon Showdown.

Installation
It requires Node.js version 6.0.0 or later and a command line (e.g. Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Mac OS/Linux) to run. Once you have compatible software, complete installation by following these steps:

Obtain a copy of Cyro Phoenix
You can do this through the GitHub client by clicking the "Clone or download" button on the home page of the repository and then clicking "Open in Desktop". You can also use the following Git command:

git clone https://github.com/arifin6686/Cyro-Phoenix.git

Navigate to the root directory
The remaining steps will take place in the root directory of your Cyro Phoenix files. Navigate there with the command:

cd DIRECTORY

Replace DIRECTORY with the filepath to your directory (e.g. C:\Users\arifin6686\Documents\GitHub\Cyro-Phoenix).

Install dependencies
Run the following command to install required dependencies:

npm install --production

If you plan to contribute to development, run the command without the --production flag to also install dependencies used for testing.

Set up the config file
Copy and paste the config-example.js file, rename it to config.js, and open it in your text editor to enter your desired information.

From this point on, you can start the bot by running the following command:

node app.js
